## Inspiration 
The listening post served as an inspiration for my work. The idea of eavesdropping snippets of texts sent by strangers sparked my imagination and curiosity. The fact that it was live added further to that, someone somewhere at this moment in time has sent this. How is that person feeling? Are they lonely? Are they having a bad day? Where are they going? Why? I tried to create context, build an identity, and connect with those stranges as I eavesdropped on their messages.
