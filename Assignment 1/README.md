## Assignment 1

For my assignment, I wrote a program that acts like a legendary poet and asks the user to choose if they to hear a song, a poem, or get some words of wisdom.


If the user selects "wise words", then it is simple. The program randomly chooses a theme such as friendship or love, and webcrapes quotes on that theme from a randomly chosen quote's website: https://quotes.toscrape.com/. The program then randomly chooses one of those scraped quotes and outputs them to the user.


The quotes are interesting and captivating. It is stimulating to wonder what quote would appear. Quotes are advices, lessons, and ideas. Learning one more quote cannot be of no value. The quote could be related to something the user is going through, something they need to hear, or just additional knowledge. The thought does not end when the quote ends, it rather resonates through the user's mind for a little while. The final output would not differ much from what a person would write, it is quotes taken in full. The only thing, however, is it includes a wider range of quotes than that of which an average person would memorize or know.


On the other hand, if the user selects either a "song" or a "poem", then the program scrapes song lyrics from multiple HTML links to those song lyrics. I chose popular songs randomly based lyrics that are appropriate and meaningful. All the lines of those songs are then merged into one large list. If the user opts for a poem, then four lines of randomly chosen verses are printed. If the user prefers a song, then a song is printed in groups of five, four, and six lines of randomly chosen lyrics, creating three stanzas.


The final output differs from what a person would write in its randomness and spontaneity. Since lines are picked randomly, with each line having an equal chance of being chosen, any combination is possible. Since that makes it as unconstrained and unprompted as it can get, it opens the door to discovering and forming very beautiful songs and poems. The algorithm may form meaning through randomness, or allow you to admire its meaninglessness with meaningless lines merged in meaningless ways.


You can never guess what the next output would be, or if it would even have any meaning or make sense. There is beauty in its ambiguity. Some outputs are heart-warming, some are cruel and scary, some leave you feeling confused. It allows you to admire randomness as art, randomness as meaningful, randomness as meaningless.


I chose this algorithm of randomly combining lines of song lyrics to form a song or poem because when I did a similar thing for one of my previous sketches the output baffled me and I wanted to play around and expand on that algorithm. I found it very interesting, and sometimes even scary, how the random chosen lines still have meaning when combined together. Not only that, but a lot of times there is also a certain theme and mood.


In my sketch, however, I only used three songs and the algorithm to generate the song is similar to what I have now. For this assignment, I added twenty more songs to see if output would be any more interesting, and yes it was. For a shorter version, I added the option of generating a poem by randomly choosing four lines from all the song lyrics combined. I wanted to make it aethetic and entertaining even for those who do not code, so I decided to make it as if it was a game and the user was visiting a legedary poet who recites a randomly generated poem or song, based on what the user chooses. Then, to add variety, and for my love of quotes, I thought of adding the option for words of wisdom. If the user chooses the option of recieving words of wisdom from this legendary poet, then he offers them with a famous quote.

## Sample Output

Wise Words: J.K. Rowling once said: “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn

So I guess I be leaving

And my heart will go on and on

I've got to move on and be who I am
